# dmx-rdm-rp2040

Library for using rp2040s/raspberry pi picos with the [dmx-rdm-rs](https://crates.io/crates/dmx-rdm) library.

This was tested using the [Waveshare Pico-2CH-RS485](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/Pico-2CH-RS485)
and does not require a pin for switching between receiving and transmitting on the transceiver.
The schematic for this board is also [available](https://files.waveshare.com/upload/0/02/Pico-2CH-RS485.pdf).
